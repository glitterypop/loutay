# Hello, Sweetie

## i know there're four words on the tip of your tongue. you'd never need to say it

### cuz i know what u know, we can feel it

### i'll keep ur secret safe 'til the time we both find ourselves alone again

### the storm is coming. u dont need sunscreen anymore

### i'll board up ur windows and we can make blanket fort

### i might never be ur knife in shining armor

### but i wanna be ur left hand not!man
